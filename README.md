# Web2All adodb wrapper

This adodb ([https://github.com/ADOdb/ADOdb](https://github.com/ADOdb/ADOdb)) wrapper for the web2all/framework ([https://github.com/web2all/framework](https://github.com/web2all/framework)) is used by almost all Web2All PHP projects which use database connections. It used to be proprietary software but now it has been released to the public domain under a MIT license.

The Web2All framework is no longer actively maintained. Most likely this adodb wrapper is only of interest if you own software created by Web2All B.V. which was built using this framework.

## What does it do ##

Set up an adodb connection using the Web2All framework for error handling/logging and  make it easy to load connection details from the configuration.

## License ##

Web2All adodb is open-sourced software licensed under the MIT license ([https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT "license")).
